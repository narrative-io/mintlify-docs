- How to verify your email via magic link (for email signups)

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the sign-up page">
    Navigate to [app.narrative.io](https://app.narrative.io) to access the sign-up page.

    You have two options to create your account:

    - **Email**: Enter your email address and click **Continue with email**
    - **Single sign-on**: Click **Continue with Google**, **Continue with GitHub**, or **Continue with LinkedIn**

    <Note>
    If you sign up with an SSO provider, skip the next step and proceed directly to completing your profile.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify your email">
    If you signed up with an email address, you'll see a confirmation that a magic link was sent to your inbox.

    </Frame>

    Open your email and find the message from Narrative. Click **Continue** to verify your email address.

    <Warning>
    The magic link expires in 1 hour. If it expires, return to the sign-up page and request a new link.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete your profile">
    Enter your name and the company you work for, then click **Complete Registration**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Accept Terms of Service">
    Review the Terms of Service. Check the box to confirm you've read and agree to the terms, then click **Agree**.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log in to your account">
    You'll see a success message confirming your account was created. Click **Login** to access Narrative I/O.

    <Frame>

    For future logins with an email account, you'll receive a magic link each time—no password required.
