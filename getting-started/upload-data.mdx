In this tutorial, you'll upload your first dataset to Narrative I/O. By the end, your data will be ready for normalization and querying.

<Info>
This tutorial is part of the First Steps series. Complete [Create an Account](/getting-started/create-account) before starting.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- A Narrative I/O account
- A CSV file to upload

<Tip>
Don't have a dataset handy? Download this [sample CSV of top domains](https://github.com/fffaraz/datasets/blob/master/top500Domains.csv) to follow along.
</Tip>

## What you'll learn

- How to navigate to the Datasets page
- How to upload a CSV file
- How to verify your dataset was created successfully

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Datasets">
    In the left sidebar, click **My Data**, then select **Datasets**.

    This takes you to [https://app.narrative.io/platform/my-data/datasets](https://app.narrative.io/platform/my-data/datasets), where you can see all your existing datasets and their statuses.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a new dataset">
    Click **New Dataset** to begin the upload process.

    You'll land on the dataset creation page at [https://app.narrative.io/platform/my-data/new-dataset](https://app.narrative.io/platform/my-data/new-dataset). This is where you'll upload your file and configure your dataset.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload your file">
    Upload your CSV file using one of these methods:

    - **Drag and drop**: Drag your file directly onto the upload area
    - **File picker**: Click the upload area to browse and select your file

    Once you select a file, the platform begins processing:
    - The file uploads to Narrative's servers
    - The system infers your schema from the data
    - Initial validation checks run automatically

    <Tip>
    Narrative also supports JSON files. For connecting external data sources like cloud storage or databases, see the [Connectors reference](/reference/connectors).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review your dataset">
    After a successful upload, you're redirected to your dataset's overview page.

    The URL follows this pattern: `https://app.narrative.io/platform/my-data/dataset/{id}#overview`

    On this page you'll see:
    - **Dataset name and metadata**: Basic information about your upload
    - **Status indicator**: Confirms the dataset was created successfully
    - **Navigation tabs**: Access to Overview, Schema, Records, and Mappings

    Your dataset now exists in Narrative and is ready for the next step: normalization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify it worked

To confirm your upload succeeded:

1. Navigate back to **My Data** → **Datasets**
2. Find your new dataset in the list
3. Check that the status shows the upload is complete
4. Click into the dataset and select the **Records** tab to preview your data

You should see your CSV data displayed with the columns the system inferred from your file.

## What you accomplished

- Navigated to the dataset management interface
- Uploaded a CSV file as a new dataset
- Verified the dataset was created and is ready for normalization

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Upload fails or times out | Check file size limits; try a smaller file or split into chunks |
| File format not supported | Ensure your file is a valid CSV or JSON format |
| Dataset shows 0 records | Verify the file has data rows, not just headers |
| Schema looks incorrect | Check that your CSV uses consistent delimiters and quoting |
