  ## Rosetta Stone Normalized Datasets Page

  Evaluate and improve your data normalization with full visibility into Rosetta Stone's AI-powered mapping confidence scores. The new Normalized Datasets view (**Rosetta Stone → Normalized Datasets**) surfaces how well your datasets map to Rosetta Stone attributes, helping you quickly identify which mappings need attention.

  - View all normalized datasets with color-coded confidence scores (high/medium/low)
  - See mapping type indicators showing AI-generated vs. manual mappings
  - Sort by columns, rows, confidence, or creation date
  - Filter by data plane to focus on specific environments
  - Search datasets by name


  ## Quick Wins

  **AI-Generated Dataset Descriptions**: Click the Rosetta icon next to any dataset description to automatically generate a rich, contextual description. Rosetta AI analyzes your dataset's schema and sample data to create descriptions that explain what the data is and where it came from—saving you from writing documentation from scratch.

  **Simplified Refresh Schedule Editor**: We removed the confusing "Advanced" mode from the refresh schedule editor based on user feedback. Need a custom cron schedule? Just describe it in plain language and Rosetta AI generates the correct cron expression for you.
