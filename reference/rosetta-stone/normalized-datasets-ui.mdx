This reference documents the UI elements, metrics, and actions available in the Normalized Datasets interface.

## Listing page

**Path:** Rosetta Stone → Normalized Datasets

The listing page displays all datasets that have Rosetta Stone mappings applied.

### Columns

| Column | Description | Sortable |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Dataset name** | Display name of the dataset; click to navigate to detail page | Yes |
| **Mappings** | Count of non-system mappings on the dataset | Yes |
| **Rows** | Total record count in the dataset | Yes |
| **Avg. Confidence** | Average confidence score across all evaluated mappings | Yes |
| **Updated** | Timestamp of the last modification to the dataset or its mappings | Yes |

### Average confidence display

The average confidence column uses color coding:

| Color | Score range | Interpretation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Green | 80-100% | Mappings are generally high quality |
| Yellow | 50-79% | Some mappings may need attention |
| Red | 0-49% | Significant mapping issues likely |
| Gray | Not evaluated | No evaluation has been run |

### Empty state

When no datasets have mappings, the listing displays a message with a link to the mapping documentation.

---

## Detail page

**Path:** Rosetta Stone → Normalized Datasets → {dataset_name}

The detail page shows evaluation results and mapping suggestions for a specific dataset. It has two tabs: **Evaluate** and **Normalize**.

---

## Evaluate tab

The Evaluate tab displays AI-powered quality scores for existing mappings.

### Confidence gradient bar

A horizontal bar at the top showing the distribution of mappings across confidence tiers:

| Section | Color | Represents |
|---------|-------|------------|
| High confidence | Green | Mappings scoring 80-100% |
| Medium confidence | Yellow | Mappings scoring 50-79% |
| Low confidence | Red | Mappings scoring 0-49% |
| Not scored | Gray | Mappings without scores |

The bar width of each section is proportional to the count of mappings in that tier.

### Confidence level cards

Four clickable cards showing mapping counts by confidence tier:

| Card | Score range | Click action |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **High** | 80-100% | Filter to show only high-confidence mappings |
| **Medium** | 50-79% | Filter to show only medium-confidence mappings |
| **Low** | 0-49% | Filter to show only low-confidence mappings |
| **Not Scored** | N/A | Filter to show only unscored mappings |

Click the active filter again or click **All** to clear the filter.

### Overview cards

Five cards displaying dataset statistics:

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total Columns** | Number of columns in the source dataset |
| **Attributes Mapped** | Count of distinct Rosetta Stone attributes with mappings |
| **System Mappings** | Mappings auto-generated for internal columns |
| **AI Mappings** | Mappings created from accepted AI suggestions |
| **User Mappings** | Mappings created manually by users |

Click a mapping type card to filter the mapping list to that type.

### LLM summary section

When an evaluation completes, this section displays an AI-generated analysis including:

- Overall quality assessment
- Key issues identified
- Recommended actions
- Patterns observed across mappings

### Transformation cards

Each mapping displays as a card showing:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Source column | The column being mapped |
| Arrow indicator | Visual showing the mapping direction |
| Target attribute | The Rosetta Stone attribute |
| Confidence badge | Score with color indicator |
| Mapping type | Icon indicating system/AI/user/lineage |
| Expand button | Shows detailed AI feedback when clicked |

**Expanded card view:**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Score breakdown | Factors contributing to the confidence score |
| Issues | Specific problems identified by the AI |
| Recommendations | Suggested improvements |
| Sample analysis | Before/after values from the dataset |

### Evaluate mappings button

**Location:** Top right of the Evaluate tab

**Action:** Triggers a new AI evaluation of all mappings on the dataset

**States:**
- **Ready:** Button displays "Evaluate Mappings"
- **Running:** Button shows loading animation; icon animates
- **Complete:** Results display in the interface

---

## Normalize tab

The Normalize tab generates and displays AI mapping suggestions for unmapped columns.

### Start analysis button

**Location:** Top of the Normalize tab (when no suggestions exist)

**Action:** Triggers AI analysis to generate mapping suggestions for unmapped columns

**States:**
- **Ready:** Button displays "Start Analysis"
- **Running:** Button shows loading animation
- **Complete:** Suggestions appear grouped by confidence

### Global warnings section

Displays dataset-level warnings from the AI analysis:

| Warning type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| High null rate | Many columns have significant null values |
| Inconsistent formats | Same column contains multiple data formats |
| Low coverage | Few columns could be mapped to known attributes |
| Duplicate columns | Multiple columns appear to contain the same data |

### Confidence group sections

Suggestions are organized into collapsible sections by confidence tier:

| Section | Initial state | Contains |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **High Confidence** | Expanded | Suggestions scoring 80-100% |
| **Medium Confidence** | Collapsed | Suggestions scoring 50-79% |
| **Low Confidence** | Collapsed | Suggestions scoring 0-49% |

Click section headers to expand or collapse.

### Accept all high confidence button

**Location:** Header of the High Confidence section

**Action:** Bulk accepts all suggestions in the high-confidence tier

**Confirmation:** Displays count of mappings to be created before proceeding

### Suggestion cards

Each suggestion displays as a card showing:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Source column | The unmapped column in your dataset |
| Target attribute | The AI-recommended Rosetta Stone attribute |
| Confidence score | 0-100% with color indicator |
| Reasoning | Brief explanation of why the AI proposed this mapping |
| Before/after samples | Example values showing transformation results |
| Accept button | Creates the mapping |
| Reject button | Dismisses the suggestion |

**Sample display format:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Original value from source | Transformed value for attribute |

Up to 5 sample pairs are shown per suggestion.
