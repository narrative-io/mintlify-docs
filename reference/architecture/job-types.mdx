The [job queue](/reference/glossary#job-queue) coordinates work between the [control plane](/concepts/primitives/control-plane) and [data planes](/concepts/primitives/data-planes). This reference describes the different types of jobs that flow through the queue.

## Overview

Jobs are the unit of work exchanged between the control plane and data plane operators. When the control plane needs something executed in a data plane, it creates a job and enqueues it. Data plane [operators](/reference/glossary#operator-data-plane) poll the queue, claim jobs, execute them, and report results.

## Job categories

{/* TODO: Document the specific job types that exist in the system */}

### Query jobs

Jobs that execute compiled SQL queries against the data plane's database engine.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Type | `query` |
| Payload | Transpiled SQL for the target database dialect |
| Result | Query results or error details |

**Related:** [Query Processing](/concepts/architecture/query-processing)

### Materialized view jobs

Jobs that refresh materialized views by executing their defining queries and storing results.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Type | `materialized_view_refresh` |
| Payload | View definition and refresh parameters |
| Result | Completion status and row counts |

**Related:** [Materialized Views](/concepts/nql/materialized-views)

### Dataset operations

{/* TODO: Document dataset-related job types (registration, schema updates, etc.) */}

Jobs that manage datasets within the data plane.

### System jobs

{/* TODO: Document system/maintenance job types */}

Administrative and maintenance jobs.
