The [job queue](/reference/glossary#job-queue) coordinates work between the [control plane](/concepts/primitives/control-plane) and [data planes](/concepts/primitives/data-planes). This reference describes the different types of jobs that flow through the queue.

## Overview

Jobs are the unit of work exchanged between the control plane and data plane operators. When the control plane needs something executed in a data plane, it creates a job and enqueues it. Data plane [operators](/reference/glossary#operator-data-plane) poll the queue, claim jobs, execute them, and report results.

## Job categories

{/* TODO: Document the specific job types that exist in the system */}

### Query jobs

Jobs that execute compiled SQL queries against the data plane's database engine. Query results are stored as a dataset in the data plane—only completion status is returned to the control plane.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Type | `query` |
| Payload | Transpiled SQL for the target database dialect |
| Result | Completion status, dataset reference, and row count |

**Related:** [Query Processing](/concepts/architecture/query-processing), [Data Flow](/concepts/architecture/data-flow)

### Materialized view jobs

Jobs that refresh materialized views by executing their defining queries and storing results.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Type | `materialized_view_refresh` |
| Payload | View definition and refresh parameters |
| Result | Completion status and row counts |

**Related:** [Materialized Views](/concepts/nql/materialized-views)

### Sample jobs

Jobs that retrieve a sample of rows from a dataset and store it in the control plane for viewing.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Type | `sample` |
| Payload | Dataset ID and sample parameters |
| Result | Completion status; sample data (up to 1,000 rows) stored in control plane |

**Related:** [Data Flow](/concepts/architecture/data-flow#how-you-view-query-results), [Managing Datasets](/guides/sdk/managing-datasets#sampling-data)

### Model inference jobs

Jobs that submit prompts to an LLM hosted within the data plane and return structured output. Unlike external AI API calls, inference jobs keep all data within customer infrastructure—no data is sent to external model providers.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Type | `model_inference` |
| Payload | Model identifier, conversation messages, inference configuration with JSON Schema |
| Result | Completion status, token usage statistics, structured output matching the schema |

Model inference jobs support multiple models from Anthropic (Claude Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) and OpenAI (GPT-4.1, o4-mini). The structured output capability guarantees predictable, typed responses suitable for programmatic consumption.

### Dataset operations

{/* TODO: Document dataset-related job types (registration, schema updates, etc.) */}

Jobs that manage datasets within the data plane.

### System jobs

{/* TODO: Document system/maintenance job types */}

Administrative and maintenance jobs.
