Connectors enable you to deliver data from Narrative to external platforms. Each connector is a pre-built integration that handles authentication, data formatting, and delivery to a specific destination.

## Connector requirements

Each connector requires specific identifier types to match users on the destination platform. Ensure your data includes at least one supported identifier before delivery.

|-----------|---------------------|
| The Trade Desk | SHA256 hashed email, MAID, or UID2 |
| Meta | SHA256 hashed email, SHA256 hashed phone |
| Google DV360 | SHA256 hashed email, SHA256 hashed phone, or hashed name + zip + country |
| TikTok | SHA256 hashed email, SHA256 hashed phone, MAID |
| Yahoo DSP | SHA256 hashed email, MAID |
| Amazon S3 | Any (file delivery) |
| Snowflake | Any (data delivery) |

## Common workflows

### Delivering first-party data

Push your own customer data to platforms for targeting:

1. [Prepare your data](/guides/ingestion/hashing-pii) with hashed identifiers
2. [Upload to a dataset](/guides/sdk/uploading-data)
3. [Map to Rosetta Stone](/guides/rosetta-stone/mapping-schemas) attributes
4. Configure and deliver through the connector

### Delivering acquired data

Activate third-party data purchased through Narrative:

1. Query data from data collaborators using NQL
2. Materialize results into a dataset
3. Deliver through the appropriate connector
