The Snowflake Native App enables bidirectional data flow between Narrative and Snowflake, allowing you to push data to Snowflake and access Snowflake data within Narrative.

## Overview

Unlike other connectors that deliver data to advertising platforms, the Snowflake integration connects your Snowflake data warehouse to Narrative's data collaboration platform. This enables:

- Pushing Narrative data to Snowflake tables
- Accessing Snowflake data within Narrative queries
- Bi-directional data collaboration workflows

## Requirements

### Snowflake configuration

- A Snowflake account with appropriate permissions
- Access to install Snowflake Native Apps
- Warehouse resources for data processing

## Installation

The Snowflake Native App is installed directly from the Snowflake Marketplace.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the app">
    Search for "Narrative" in the Snowflake Marketplace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Native App">
    Follow Snowflake's installation process to add the app to your account.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Narrative">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with data

Once installed, you can:

- **Export to Snowflake**: Deliver query results or dataset contents to Snowflake tables
- **Import from Snowflake**: Access Snowflake data as datasets within Narrative
- **Bi-directional sync**: Keep data synchronized between both platforms

## Data flows

The Native App supports various data flow patterns depending on your use case:

- One-time data exports
- Scheduled recurring exports
