The Amazon S3 Connector delivers data files directly to your S3 bucket, enabling flexible data export for custom integrations and analytics workflows.

## Overview

Unlike advertising platform connectors that format data for specific destinations, the S3 Connector delivers your data as files in your chosen format. This makes it ideal for:

- Custom downstream processing
- Integration with data warehouses
- Backup and archival
- Feeding other systems that consume files from S3

## Requirements

### AWS configuration

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| S3 bucket | The destination bucket for your data |
| IAM credentials | Access key and secret with write permissions to the bucket |
| Bucket policy | Permissions allowing Narrative to write to the bucket |

### Supported formats

The connector can deliver data in multiple file formats:
- CSV
- JSON
- Parquet

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the connector">

## Managed S3 buckets

If you don't have an existing S3 bucket, Narrative can provision a managed bucket for you. Contact your Narrative representative to set up a managed S3 destination.
