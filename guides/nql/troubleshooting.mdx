When an NQL query fails, the platform returns a structured error response with details about what went wrong. This section helps you diagnose and resolve common errors.

## Understanding error responses

NQL errors return a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "https://www.narrative.io/knowledge-base/...",
  "title": "Error Title",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "Detailed explanation of what went wrong",
  "instance": "/nql/run",
  "logId": "unique-error-identifier"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `type` | URL identifying the error type |
| `title` | Brief error summary |
| `status` | HTTP status code (typically 422 for validation errors) |
| `detail` | Detailed explanation of the problem |
| `instance` | The API endpoint that produced the error |
| `logId` | Unique identifier for support requests |

<Tip>
When contacting support about an error, include the `logId` value to help quickly identify your specific issue.

## General troubleshooting steps

1. **Read the error detail** — The `detail` field usually explains exactly what's wrong
2. **Check the instance** — Identifies whether the error occurred during parsing (`/nql/parse`) or execution (`/nql/run`)
3. **Review your query** — Look for the specific element mentioned in the error
4. **Consult the reference** — Check [NQL syntax](/reference/nql/syntax) and [data types](/reference/nql/data-types) for supported operations
