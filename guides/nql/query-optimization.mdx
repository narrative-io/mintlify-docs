Efficient queries are essential for working with large datasets in Narrative. This section covers optimization techniques and patterns to help your queries run faster and use fewer resources.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into optimization, you should have:

- Basic familiarity with [NQL syntax](/reference/nql/syntax)
- Understanding of [JOIN operations](/guides/nql/joining-datasets)
