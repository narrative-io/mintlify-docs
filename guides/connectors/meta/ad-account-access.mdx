When setting up a Meta Connector profile, you may see your ad account listed but be unable to select it. This prevents you from completing profile creation for that ad account.

This issue typically occurs due to permissions, verification, or terms of service requirements on the Meta platform.

## Accept Custom Audiences Terms of Service

**Cause:** You haven't accepted Meta's Custom Audiences Terms of Service for the specific ad account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Terms of Service page">
    Open the Meta Custom Audiences Terms of Service using this URL format:
    ```
    https://business.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos/?act=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` with your Meta ad account ID (numbers only, without the `act_` prefix).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept the Terms of Service">
    Review and accept the Terms of Service if you haven't already.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry profile creation">
    Return to the Narrative Meta Connector and try creating the profile again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify your role permissions

**Cause:** Your Meta account doesn't have sufficient permissions on the ad account.

You must have at least **Advertiser** or **Ad Account Admin** role on the ad account. The **Ad Account Advertiser** role or higher is required to create Custom Audiences.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact your Business Manager admin">
    Ask them to verify your role on the ad account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request elevated permissions">
    If you don't have sufficient access, request **Advertiser** or **Ad Account Admin** permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update permissions in Business Manager">
    In Meta Business Manager, roles can be updated under **Ad Accounts** > Select your ad account > **People** > Edit user permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Complete business verification

**Cause:** The Business Manager that owns the ad account hasn't completed Meta's business verification process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Business Verification">
    Log into your Meta Business Manager and navigate to **Business Settings** > **Security Center** > **Business Verification**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the verification process">
    Follow Meta's prompts to verify your business. This process may take several days to complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry profile creation">
    Once verification is complete, try creating the Meta Connector profile again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Business verification is a Meta requirement, not a Narrative requirement. Learn more in [Meta's Business Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2058515294227817).
</Note>

## Verify ad account association

**Cause:** The ad account is not properly associated with the Business Manager account you're logged into.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirm the correct Business Manager">
    Verify that you're logged into the correct Meta Business Manager account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check ad account assignment">
    In Business Manager, go to **Business Settings** > **Ad Accounts** and confirm the ad account you're trying to connect is listed and properly associated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add or request access if missing">
    If the ad account is missing, you may need to:
    - Request access to the ad account from its owner
    - Add the ad account to your Business Manager (if you own it)
    - Log into the correct Business Manager that owns the ad account
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Additional troubleshooting steps

If the solutions above don't resolve your issue:

- **Clear browser cache** — Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try again
- **Try a different browser** — Some browser extensions may interfere with the connection process
- **Check Meta status** — Verify that Meta's systems are operational at [Meta Status](https://metastatus.com/)
- **Wait and retry** — Temporary syncing delays between Meta's systems occasionally occur
