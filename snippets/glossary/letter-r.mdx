### Relationships

Connections between datasets that enable querying across multiple related data sources. Relationships allow organizations to join and analyze data across different datasets while respecting access controls.

### Right to erasure

A data subject right under GDPR (also known as the "right to be forgotten") allowing individuals to request deletion of their personal data under certain circumstances, such as when the data is no longer necessary, when consent is withdrawn, or when processing was unlawful. Similar deletion rights exist under CCPA.

### Rosetta Stone

Narrative's schema normalization system that enables data collaboration across organizations with different data structures. Rosetta Stone uses two core primitives—attributes (standardized field definitions) and mappings (translations between source columns and attributes)—to automatically normalize data from multiple sources into a queryable common schema.

The system combines machine learning and human curation to create accurate mappings, handles schema changes transparently, and eliminates the need for custom ETL pipelines between partners.
