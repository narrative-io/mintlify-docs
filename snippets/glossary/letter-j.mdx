### Job queue

A [control plane](#control-plane) component that coordinates work between the control plane and [data planes](#data-plane). The job queue holds various types of jobs—including compiled queries, dataset operations, and system tasks—that data plane [operators](#operator-data-plane) poll and execute. This pull-based architecture ensures the control plane never needs direct access to data plane infrastructure.
