## A

### Access grant

An explicit permission that allows a specific organization to query a dataset they don't own. Access grants enable controlled data sharing between organizations while maintaining ownership and governance.

### Access rules

Policies that define who can access specific datasets or fields within the Narrative platform. Access rules are enforced at query execution time and can be configured at both the dataset and field level.

### Attributes

Standardized field definitions in Rosetta Stone that form the common schema for data normalization. Each attribute has an immutable numeric ID, a name, description, type, and optional validations. Attributes can be global (platform-wide standards like `hl7_gender`) or organization-specific (scoped to one organization and its collaborators). Also referred to as **normalized attributes** or **Rosetta Stone attributes**.
