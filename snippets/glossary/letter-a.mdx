### Access rules

Business rules that define how other organizations can access data within the Narrative platform. Access rules give data owners fine-grained control over who can query their data, what records and fields are accessible, and how much access costs. Every dataset requires at least one access rule before other organizations can query it.

Access rules are enforced at query execution time by the control plane and data planes. They support flexible pricing (including free access for non-commercial sharing), partner-specific permissions, and field-level controls.

### Attributes

Standardized field definitions in Rosetta Stone that form the common schema for data normalization. Each attribute has an immutable numeric ID, a name, description, type, and optional validations. Attributes can be global (platform-wide standards like `hl7_gender`) or organization-specific (scoped to one organization and its collaborators). Also referred to as **normalized attributes** or **Rosetta Stone attributes**.
