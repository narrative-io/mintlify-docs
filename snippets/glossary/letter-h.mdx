## H

### Hash function

A one-way mathematical algorithm that converts input data (like an email address) into a fixed-length string of characters. Hash functions are deterministic (same input always produces same output), non-reversible (you cannot recover the original input from the hash), and collision-resistant (different inputs produce different outputs). Common hash functions include MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

### Hash join

An efficient join algorithm where the query planner builds a hash table from one table's join keys and probes it with the other table's keys. Hash joins require single-key equality conditions and are significantly faster than nested loop joins for large datasets.
