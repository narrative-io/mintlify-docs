### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)

A comprehensive privacy law that gives California residents rights over their personal information, including the rights to know what data is collected, to delete it, to opt-out of its sale, and to non-discrimination for exercising these rights. As amended by CPRA, it applies to for-profit businesses meeting certain revenue or data volume thresholds.

### Consent

In privacy law, a data subject's freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of agreement to the processing of their personal data. Under GDPR, consent is one of six legal bases for processing. Under CCPA, consent is typically required for selling personal information of minors.

### Control plane

The centralized orchestration layer that manages metadata, enforces permissions, and coordinates queries across data planes. The control plane never touches raw data directly—it only handles the coordination and governance aspects of data collaboration.

### Cookie syncing

The process of sharing cookie-based identifiers between domains by passing IDs as query parameters. Because web browsers enforce same-origin policies that prevent one domain from reading another domain's cookies, cookie syncing creates a shared understanding of user identity across separate cookie namespaces.

### Company ID

A unique identifier assigned to each partner or customer organization on the Narrative data collaboration platform. Company IDs are used internally to identify organizations in API calls, integrations, and data collaboration workflows.

### Confidence score

A numerical rating (0-100%) generated by AI that indicates the likely accuracy of a Rosetta Stone mapping. Higher scores suggest the mapping is more reliable. Confidence scores are calculated based on column name analysis, data sample inspection, and transformation logic evaluation. Scores are grouped into tiers: high (80-100%), medium (50-79%), and low (0-49%).

### CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act)

An amendment to CCPA that took effect January 1, 2023, strengthening California's privacy law by adding new consumer rights (correction, limiting sensitive data use), creating the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) for enforcement, and expanding business obligations.
