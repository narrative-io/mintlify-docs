## C

### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)

A comprehensive privacy law that gives California residents rights over their personal information, including the rights to know what data is collected, to delete it, to opt-out of its sale, and to non-discrimination for exercising these rights. As amended by CPRA, it applies to for-profit businesses meeting certain revenue or data volume thresholds.

### Chunking

An automatic query execution strategy that splits large dataset scans into smaller, time-bounded segments. Chunking improves stability and cost efficiency for queries over very large datasets (tens of gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes) by limiting the blast radius of failures and enabling targeted retries. The platform determines when chunking applies based on query structure—no user configuration is required.

### Committed-Usage

A pricing model that provides discounted usage rates when you commit to a set amount of platform usage over a period of time. Unlike pay-as-you-go pricing, Committed-Usage requires a contractual agreement and offers rates negotiated with Narrative's sales team.

### Consent

In privacy law, a data subject's freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of agreement to the processing of their personal data. Under GDPR, consent is one of six legal bases for processing. Under CCPA, consent is typically required for selling personal information of minors.

### Control plane

The centralized orchestration layer that manages metadata, enforces permissions, and coordinates queries across data planes. The control plane never touches raw data directly—it only handles the coordination and governance aspects of data collaboration.

### Cookie syncing

The process of sharing cookie-based identifiers between domains by passing IDs as query parameters. Because web browsers enforce same-origin policies that prevent one domain from reading another domain's cookies, cookie syncing creates a shared understanding of user identity across separate cookie namespaces.

### Company ID

A unique identifier assigned to each partner or customer organization on the Narrative data collaboration platform. Company IDs are used internally to identify organizations in API calls, integrations, and data collaboration workflows.

To find the company name associated with a Company ID, or to determine your own organization's Company ID, contact your Narrative partner success representative or [reach out to support](mailto:support@narrative.io).

### Confidence score

A numerical rating (0-100%) generated by AI that indicates the likely accuracy of a Rosetta Stone mapping. Higher scores suggest the mapping is more reliable. Confidence scores are calculated based on column name analysis, data sample inspection, and transformation logic evaluation. Scores are grouped into tiers: high (80-100%), medium (50-79%), and low (0-49%).

### Connector

A pre-built integration that connects Narrative to an external destination platform. Connectors handle the complexities of data delivery including format translation, identity matching, API integration, and audience management. Each connector is specific to a destination (e.g., The Trade Desk Connector, Meta Connector).

### CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act)

An amendment to CCPA that took effect January 1, 2023, strengthening California's privacy law by adding new consumer rights (correction, limiting sensitive data use), creating the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) for enforcement, and expanding business obligations.
