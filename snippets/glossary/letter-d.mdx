### Data collaboration

The process by which multiple organizations share, query, and analyze each other's data while maintaining control and compliance. Data collaboration in Narrative enables organizations to unlock value from combined datasets without sacrificing data governance.

### Data controller

Under GDPR, an entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. The controller decides what data to collect, why to collect it, and how it will be used. Controllers bear primary responsibility for compliance with data protection principles.

**Related:** [Data processor](#data-processor), [GDPR](/concepts/compliance/gdpr)

### Data crosswalk

A method for linking or matching records across different data sources without exposing the underlying identifiers. In privacy-safe implementations, crosswalks use pseudonymization techniques like hashing to enable record matching while protecting individual privacy. Data crosswalks are essential for data collaboration scenarios where organizations need to find common records (such as overlapping customers) without sharing raw PII.

### Data enrichment

The process of enhancing existing customer or audience data with additional attributes from external sources. Common enrichment attributes include demographics (age, gender), location data, purchase behavior, and interest signals. In Narrative, enrichment is performed by joining seed datasets with provider data through Rosetta Stone identity matching. Unlike per-use data licensing models, enriched data can typically be used across multiple platforms and use cases under an omni-use license.

### Data plane

The infrastructure where data physically resides and where queries execute. Data planes can be hosted by Narrative (Narrative-hosted) or deployed within a customer's own infrastructure (customer-hosted) for maximum control over data residency.

**Related:** [Data Planes](/concepts/primitives/data-planes)

### Data portability

A data subject right under GDPR allowing individuals to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format and to transmit that data to another controller. This right supports individuals' ability to switch between service providers.

**Related:** [GDPR](/concepts/compliance/gdpr)

### Data processor

Under GDPR, an entity that processes personal data on behalf of a data controller. Processors act only on the controller's documented instructions and must maintain appropriate security measures. Service providers under CCPA serve a similar role.

**Related:** [Data controller](#data-controller), [GDPR](/concepts/compliance/gdpr)

### Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

A legally binding contract between a data controller and data processor that governs the processing of personal data. Required under GDPR, DPAs specify the subject matter, duration, nature, and purpose of processing, as well as the processor's obligations regarding data security, sub-processors, and data subject rights.

**Related:** [Data controller](#data-controller), [Data processor](#data-processor), [GDPR](/concepts/compliance/gdpr)

### Data products

Curated, packaged datasets designed for sharing with partner organizations. Data products include relevant metadata, access controls, and documentation to enable effective data collaboration.

### Data subject

Under GDPR, an identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data is being processed. Data subjects have various rights including access, rectification, erasure, and data portability.

**Related:** [GDPR](/concepts/compliance/gdpr)

### Data Subject Request (DSR)

A formal request from a data subject exercising their rights under privacy laws such as GDPR or CCPA. DSRs include opt-out requests (where the data subject asks to be removed from marketing or advertising) and data erasure requests (where the data subject requests complete deletion of their personal data). In Narrative, DSRs are submitted by mapping identifiers to the Data Privacy Request Identifier attribute, which automatically excludes those identifiers from queries and propagates requests to downstream data collaborators.

### Dataset

A structured collection of data registered in Narrative with a defined schema. Datasets function like database tables—they have fields (columns), hold records (rows), and can be queried using NQL. Each dataset is owned by a single company, scoped to a specific data plane, and can be shared with other organizations through access rules.

**Related:** [Datasets](/concepts/primitives/datasets), [Managing Datasets](/guides/sdk/managing-datasets)

### Data sample

A preview of up to 1,000 rows from a dataset, retrieved via a sampling job and stored in the [control plane](#control-plane) for quick access through the API or UI. Samples are used to view [interactive query](#interactive-query) results and inspect dataset contents without downloading the full dataset from the [data plane](#data-plane). Samples can be requested on demand and cleared when no longer needed.

**Related:** [Data Flow](/concepts/architecture/data-flow#how-you-view-query-results), [Managing Datasets](/guides/sdk/managing-datasets#sampling-data)

### Device alias

A data field that provides details about a user's device, broken out into make, model, and operating system. Device alias data helps categorize user devices and is collected through SDKs or real-time bidding environments. Examples include "iPhone X, iOS 13.3.1" or "Pixel 3, Android 10.0".

### Encoding space

The per-partner namespace for Narrative IDs. The same clear text identifier encoded for different partners produces different Narrative IDs, ensuring that identifiers cannot be correlated across partners without going through Narrative's translation functionality.
