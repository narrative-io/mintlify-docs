### Transaction Services Fee

A service fee calculated as a percentage of the Licensed Data Fees transacted on Narrative's platform. For pay-as-you-go customers, the rate is 25% of Licensed Data Fees. This fee applies to data you transact, source, or facilitate on the platform or via Narrative Services, including via any Connector App.

### Transfer Fee

A service fee based on the volume of bytes transferred out of your Narrative account per month, also known as an egress fee. For pay-as-you-go customers, the rate is $1.50/GB. Egress transfers to client-owned locations within AWS Region "us-east-1" (US East, N. Virginia) do not incur Transfer Fees.

### Transpilation

The process of converting [NQL](#nql-narrative-query-language) code to equivalent native SQL code for a specific database system. The [control plane](#control-plane) transpiles NQL to Snowflake SQL, Spark SQL, or other dialects depending on where the target [data plane](#data-plane) stores its data. Transpilation is distinct from compilation in that it produces human-readable code in another query language rather than machine code.

### Transformation expression

An NQL expression used within a Rosetta Stone mapping to convert source data to the target attribute format. Transformation expressions can include type conversions, string manipulation, conditional logic (CASE statements), and null handling. They enable mappings to normalize diverse source formats into consistent attribute values.
