## P

### PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

Data that can be used to identify a specific individual, either directly or in combination with other data. Common examples include email addresses, phone numbers, names, addresses, and government-issued IDs. Narrative requires that PII be pseudonymized (hashed) before upload to protect individual privacy.

### Pseudonymization

A data protection technique that replaces directly identifying information with artificial identifiers (pseudonyms). In Narrative's context, pseudonymization is achieved by hashing PII such as email addresses and phone numbers. Unlike anonymization, pseudonymized data can still be matched across datasets (same input produces same hash) while protecting individual privacy.

### Placeholder (query template)

A variable element in a [query template](#query-template) marked with `{{name}}` syntax that is replaced with a user-provided value at execution time. Placeholder types include literal values (strings, numbers, dates), columns, filters, and output fields. Each placeholder has metadata including name, type, description, and whether it is required.

### Processing Fee

A service fee based on the volume of bytes processed per month during usage of Narrative's products and services. Processing includes ingestion, evaluation, transactions, forecasting, and order management. For pay-as-you-go customers, the rate is $0.65/GB. Processing fees may be waived for activity directly supporting data transactions under certain conditions.

### Prompt Studio

A UI tool for transforming datasets into structured, fine-tuning-ready examples for AI models. Prompt Studio allows you to configure system, user, and assistant prompts with dynamic macros that pull values from dataset fields, NQL expressions, or literal text. Each row in the source dataset becomes a conversation-formatted training example.
