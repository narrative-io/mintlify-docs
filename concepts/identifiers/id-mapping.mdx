ID mapping connects different identifiers to the same user, enabling cross-device targeting, measurement, and analytics. When a data provider links a hashed email to a mobile advertising ID, or a cookie to a device identifier, they create an ID mapping that bridges previously siloed data.

## Why ID mapping matters

Modern consumers interact with brands across multiple touchpoints:
- Mobile apps (identified by MAID)
- Websites on desktop (identified by cookies)
- Email communications (identified by email address)
- Connected TV (identified by device graphs)

Without ID mapping, each touchpoint exists in isolation. A retailer might show the same ad to a customer on mobile, desktop, and CTV without recognizing it's the same person—wasting budget and creating a poor experience.

ID mapping solves this by creating links between identifiers, enabling:
- **Unified targeting:** Reach the same person across devices
- **Frequency capping:** Limit ad exposure across channels
- **Attribution:** Connect conversions to the right touchpoints
- **Audience expansion:** Find customers in new channels

## Common ID linkages

### Hashed Email to MAID

The most valuable and deterministic mapping connects hashed emails to mobile advertising IDs.

**How it works:** When a user logs into a mobile app with their email address, the app developer can link the MAID (from the device) to the hashed email (from the login). This creates a deterministic, high-confidence link.

**Use cases:**
- Target email subscribers in mobile apps
- Extend CRM audiences to mobile advertising
- Measure mobile conversions against email campaigns

### Cookie to MAID

Connects web browsing behavior to mobile device identity.

**How it works:**
- Cookie syncing through pixel fires on mobile web
- SDK-based matching when users interact on both web and app
- Probabilistic matching based on shared signals (IP, location, behavior)

**Use cases:**
- Retarget website visitors in mobile apps
- Build unified user profiles across web and app
- Measure cross-platform campaign performance

### Cookie to Hashed Email

Links browser-based identity to email-based identity.

**How it works:** When users log in on websites, the site can link their cookie to their hashed email. This creates a durable identifier that persists even when cookies are cleared.

**Use cases:**
- Build persistent identity across browser sessions
- Connect anonymous browsing to known customers
- Enable email-based audience activation

## ID mapping quality

Not all ID mappings are equal. Consider these quality factors:

### Deterministic vs. probabilistic

| Type | Description | Confidence |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Deterministic** | Direct observation of link (e.g., same user logged in) | High |
| **Probabilistic** | Inferred from signals (e.g., shared IP, similar behavior) | Variable |

Deterministic mappings are more accurate but harder to scale. Probabilistic mappings offer broader reach but may include false matches.

### Recency

ID mappings can become stale:
- Users reset their MAIDs
- Cookies expire or are cleared
- Email addresses change

More recent mappings are generally more reliable.

### Source quality

The method of collection matters:
- **First-party login data:** Highest quality
- **SDK integrations:** High quality
- **Cookie syncing:** Medium quality
- **Probabilistic inference:** Variable quality

## ID mapping in Narrative

Narrative enables ID mapping through several mechanisms:

### Standardized identifiers

When ingesting data, Narrative normalizes identifier formats to enable matching across sources:
- Consistent casing for MAIDs
- Standardized hashing for emails and phones
- Narrative Cookie IDs for cross-supplier cookie matching

### Cross-supplier matching

Different data suppliers use different cookie namespaces. Narrative creates a standardized cookie ID that links to each supplier's cookies, enabling matching across suppliers.

### Query-time joining

Use NQL to join datasets on shared identifiers:

```sql
SELECT
  a.hashed_email,
  b.maid
FROM company_a."email_data" a
JOIN company_b."maid_data" b
  ON a.narrative_id = b.narrative_id
```

## Privacy considerations

ID mapping must respect privacy regulations and user expectations:

- **Consent:** Ensure mappings are created with appropriate user consent
- **Pseudonymization:** Always hash PII before creating mappings
- **Data minimization:** Only create mappings needed for specific use cases
- **User controls:** Honor opt-outs across all linked identifiers
