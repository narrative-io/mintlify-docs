Data onboarding is the process of taking offline customer data and connecting it to online identifiers for digital activation. It bridges the gap between CRM systems, point-of-sale data, and loyalty programs with the digital advertising ecosystem.

## Why data onboarding matters

Many companies have rich customer data from offline interactions:
- Purchase history from retail stores
- Loyalty program memberships
- Call center interactions
- Direct mail campaigns

But digital advertising platforms work with online identifiers—cookies, mobile ad IDs, and universal IDs. Without onboarding, this valuable first-party data remains unusable for digital marketing.

Data onboarding unlocks:
- **Digital reach for offline customers:** Find your store customers online
- **Personalization at scale:** Apply offline insights to digital experiences
- **Closed-loop measurement:** Connect digital campaigns to offline conversions

## How data onboarding works

### 1. Prepare and anonymize offline data

Data onboarding starts with your offline customer file—typically including emails, phone numbers, and customer attributes.

Before any matching occurs, personally identifiable information (PII) must be pseudonymized:
- Hash email addresses and phone numbers
- Remove or mask direct identifiers (names, addresses)
- Retain only the attributes needed for activation

<Note>
Narrative requires PII to be hashed before upload. See [Hashing PII for Upload](/guides/ingestion/hashing-pii) for formatting requirements.

### 2. Match to online identifiers

Pseudonymized customer data is matched to online identifiers through identity resolution:

| Offline Identifier | Matched To |
|-------------------|------------|
| Hashed email | Mobile ad IDs, cookies, UID2 |
| Hashed phone | Mobile ad IDs, UID2 |
| Postal address | Device graphs (probabilistic) |

Matching can be:
- **Deterministic:** Direct link observed (e.g., user logged in with email on mobile app)
- **Probabilistic:** Inferred from signals (e.g., shared household IP address)

### 3. Activate in digital channels

Once matched, customer segments can be activated across digital platforms:
- Programmatic display and video
- Social media advertising
- Connected TV
- Retail media networks

## Benefits of data onboarding

### Boost media reach

By appending online identifiers to your customer file, you gain additional touchpoints to reach customers across devices and channels—not just where they gave you their email.

### Improve personalization

Bring offline insights online. A customer who purchased in-store can receive relevant digital ads, while someone who returned a product can be excluded from promotions.

### Enable omni-channel measurement

Combining offline and online data provides a complete view of customer journeys. Measure how digital campaigns drive store visits, or how in-store experiences influence online behavior.

### Power advanced analytics

Onboarded data enables analysis across the full customer journey. Understand how offline and online touchpoints interact and influence each other, rather than analyzing channels in silos.

## Challenges in data onboarding

### Privacy compliance

Offline customer records often contain PII that's regulated under GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws. Mitigate risk by:
- Hashing all identifiers before sharing
- Maintaining appropriate consent records
- Working with compliant onboarding partners

### Match rates

Not all offline customers will match to online identifiers. Typical match rates range from 30-70% depending on:
- Data quality and recency
- Identifier types available
- Target platform coverage

### Data freshness

Customer data changes over time. Email addresses become invalid, people move, devices are replaced. Regular refresh of onboarded data maintains accuracy.

### Cost and complexity

Traditional onboarding services can be expensive and require long-term commitments. They may also charge for records that don't match, making ROI difficult to predict.

## Data onboarding in Narrative

Narrative simplifies data onboarding with transparent matching and flexible activation:

### Self-service upload

Upload your hashed customer file directly to the platform without intermediaries.

### Transparent matching

See which identity providers match your data and at what rates. Choose which matches to activate based on quality and coverage.

### Flexible activation

Activate matched audiences to multiple destinations:
- The Trade Desk (with automatic UID2 generation)
- Other DSPs and ad platforms
- Analytics environments

### Pay for matches

Only pay for records that successfully match to online identifiers.
