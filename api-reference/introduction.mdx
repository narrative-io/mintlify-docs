---

The Narrative REST API provides programmatic access to all platform functionality. Use the API to automate workflows, build custom integrations, and connect external systems to your data collaboration environment.

## Overview

The API follows REST conventions with:

- Resource-oriented URLs (e.g., `/datasets`, `/access-rules`)
- Standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON-encoded request and response bodies
- Standard HTTP status codes for success and error states

## Base URL

All API requests use the following base URL:

```
https://api.narrative.io
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.narrative.io/datasets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## SDK alternative

For TypeScript and JavaScript applications, consider using the official SDK instead of calling the REST API directly. The SDK provides type safety, convenient methods, and simplified error handling.
